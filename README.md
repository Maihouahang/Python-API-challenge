Description:

There is two parts to this project. First, I will create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Second, I will use my weather data skills to plan future vacations.

Xpert Learning Assistant. 2024. Assistance with WeatherPy.ipynb step 12 in how to define a function to create a linear regression plot. I learned to use functions I'm not so familiar with such as  # Perform linear regression: slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = stats.linregress(x_values, y_values) and  # Label plot and annotate the line equation: plt.annotate.

I was not sure how to write the function and had used Xpert Learning Assistant's example to get me started. Retrieved from (https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/6344/external_tools/313)

Xpert Learning Assistant. 2024. Assistance with VacationPy.ipynb step 6 in what to put inside the params such as  "limit":limit and "categories": "accommodation.hotel". I also had help with how to add the current city's latitude and longitude to the params dictionary. Xpert Learning assistant helped me with how to write these two functions: params["filter"] = f"circle:{longitude},{latitude},{radius}" and params["bias"] = f"proximity:{longitude},{latitude}".
